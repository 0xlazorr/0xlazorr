# LAZORR
## Blockchain Developer 
Hey there! 👋
I'm Lazorr, a Web2,Web3 Deveoper. I write code that usually works, and when it doesn’t, I call it “experimental features.”<br>

About Me:<br>
🌱 Currently learning Javascript, Solidity and Rust.
🚀 I’m looking to collaborate on Javascript and EVM projects.
💬 As a bonus, I also design frontends using tools like Figma and Canva, and I also hunt for bugs in Blockchain projects — I Audit Smart Contracts.

⚡ Fun fact: I actually do enjoy programming and chess but i still dont believe i pass for a NERD. <br>
